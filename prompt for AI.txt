Create a modern, colorful, student-friendly Vocabulary App (web app) with 3 pages: Home, Unit 5, and Unit 6.
1) Home Page
•	Title: “Vocabulary Practice App”
•	Two large, modern buttons (card-style, 3D look):
1.	Unit 5 Words
2.	Unit 6 Words
•	Clicking a button opens the relevant unit page.
2) Unit Pages (Unit 5 Page + Unit 6 Page)
Each unit page should:
•	Have a page title (e.g., “Unit 5 Words” / “Unit 6 Words”)
•	Have a Home button at the top (or top-left) to return to the Home page
•	Display the words in a grid of card-shaped tiles (responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2–3 columns on desktop)
3) Word Cards (Very Important Layout)
Each word should appear in a visually appealing 3D, modern, colorful card and must include:
1.	Number + Word
Example: “01. anecdote”
2.	Emoji related to the meaning
Show an emoji next to the word (example: anecdote → 🗣️ or 📖)
3.	Speaker icon (Audio Pronunciation)
•	Place a speaker icon 🔊 near the word
•	When clicked, it should play an audio file stored in the same folder
•	Audio filename must match the entry number format:
o	Unit 5 word 1 = 501.mp3 / Unit 6 word 3 = 603.mp3
•	On Unit 5 page, audio files are 501.mp3 to 520.mp3
•	On Unit 6 page, audio files are also 601.mp3 to 620.mp3 (separate folder/page context is fine)
•	Also the speaker icon should stop other sounds
4.	Under the word, show content with clear headings:
•	Meaning: (short, student-friendly definition)
•	Example: (one example sentence)
o	The entry word inside the sentence must be bold
o	And the bold word should be in a different color
•	Synonyms: (list format)
•	Antonyms: (list format)
4) Style Requirements
•	Use a modern, 3D, colorful design
•	Cards should have:
o	soft shadows
o	rounded corners
o	subtle gradients
o	hover animation (lift / glow)
•	Use clear readable fonts and strong headings
•	Make it feel like a premium learning app for students
5) Content Generation Rules
For each word:
•	Generate:
o	A suitable emoji
o	A simple meaning
o	One example sentence appropriate for school students
o	3–5 synonyms
